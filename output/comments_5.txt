3. Thanks so much -- I'm literally in the middle of a 3 day edit of a 20 minute video for my Dad vlog channel and I know it's going to get around 200 views. One video I made 4 years ago just popped off with 10s of 1000s of views
4. Great video! I would just add that the platform seem to reward "momentum". Once you catch the wave, it's easy to get views. But if you fall out the surfboard, you're gonna end up drowning.
5. I just watched this video and it was ok
